# my-drawings-on-vsc-epic-wow
idk js some stuff I drew on visual studio code to practice the turtle painter for school

There is probably either nothing here or barley anything, if there is something, it will probably be unfinished code.
Do not expect anything good I literally learned how to do ts like the week of 10/10 or somehwere around there

This is simply for fun and so I can be good at ts and get used to it.

once i figure out how to get vsc properly running on my home comupter I will start updating this with actual stuff. I don't know how to downlaod it heere since the computers at my school already had a lot downloaded and we went through a step by step but I forget it all alr </33
