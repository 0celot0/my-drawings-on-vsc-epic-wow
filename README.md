idk js some stuff I drew on visual studio code to practice the turtle painter for school

There is probably either nothing here or barley anything, if there is something, it will probably be unfinished code.
Do not expect anything good I literally learned how to do ts like the week of 10/10 or somehwere around there

This is simply for fun and so I can be good at ts and get used to it.

okay idk how to get stuff running without visual studio code but there will be like an organized file w videos of it from my computer !!
